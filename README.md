## Credits:
1. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72316837/vite-error-during-the-deployment-to-heroku (Help with Heroku deployment issue. Vite wasn't found when attempting to deploy to Heroku. Vite is a devDependency in the package.json at the root of the client directory. Heroku prunes devDeps to minimize app size. Command line code: heroku config:set NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false fixed this issue. Alternatively, we can add CONFIG VARS with the KEY of NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION and VALUE of false.)
